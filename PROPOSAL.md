## User Stories

#### MVP Goals

- As a player, I want to spin the reels and see visual feedback on the outcome, including (if i am lucky) winning combinations, so that I can understand when I win.
- As a player, I would like the game to display a clear message or image when I hit a winning combination, so that I feel like a winner.
- As a player, I want the game to be user-friendly.
- As a player, I expect the game to have basic sound effects or background music to enhance the gaming experience, as well as sound effects for when I win or loose.
- As a player, I would like the option to restart the game with a new spin after a win or loss, so that I can continue playing.
  
#### Stretch Goals

- As a player, I would like a victory animation when I win the game, a good idea would be confetti.
- As a player, I want a feature to track my game history and stats.
